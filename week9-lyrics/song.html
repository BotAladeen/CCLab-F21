<h1 class="heading-style"><b><i>The River </i> </b>by Bruce Springsteen</h1>
<p><b>Lyrics:</b></p>
    <p class="lyric-style">I come from down in the valley <br>
    Where, mister, when you're young <br>
    They bring you up to do like your daddy done <br>
    Me and Mary we met in high school <br>
    When she was just seventeen <br>
    We drive out of this valley <br>
    Down to where the fields were green <br>
    We'd go down to the river <br>
    And into the river we'd dive <br>
    Oh, down to the river we'd ride <br>
    Then I got Mary pregnant <br>
    And man, that was all she wrote <br>
    And for my nineteenth birthday <br>
    I got a union card and a wedding coat <br>
    We went down to the courthouse <br>
    And the judge put it all to rest <br>
    No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle <br>
    No flowers, no wedding dress <br>
    That night we went down to the river <br>
    And into the river we'd dive <br>
    Oh, down to the river we did ride <br>
    Yeah, yeah <br>
    I got a job working construction <br>
    For the Johnstown Company <br>
    But lately there ain't been much work <br>
    On account of the economy <br>
    Now all them things that seemed so important <br>
    Well mister they vanished right into the air <br>
    Now I just act like I don't remember <br>
    Mary acts like she don't care <br>
    But I remember us riding in my brother's car <br>
    Her body tan and wet, down at the reservoir <br>
    At night on them banks I'd lie awake <br>
    And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take <br>
    Now those memories come back to haunt me <br>
    They haunt me like a curse <br>
    Is a dream a lie if it don't come true <br>
    Or is it something worse <br>
    That sends me down to the river <br>
    Though I know the river is dry <br>
    That sends me down to the river tonight <br>
    Down to the river <br>
    My baby and I <br>
    Oh, down to the river we ride-ide <br></p>

    <p>"The River" is a song written and recorded by Bruce Springsteen, accompanied by the E Street Band, in 1979. The title track of his fifth album, it was a hit single in parts of Europe in 1981; it reached No. 25 in the Netherlands, and the top 10 in both Sweden and Norway. Its B-side was either "Independence Day" or "Ramrod", depending on the country of release.</p>

    <p>"The River" makes use of a haunting harmonica part, and in some ways is a foreshadowing of the style of his next album, Nebraska. The imagery of the chorus and the end of the song were inspired by lines from Hank Williams' 1950 hit "Long Gone Lonesome Blues". The song's depiction of how economic difficulties are interlaced with local culture also presaged the 1980s popularity of heartland rock:</p>
